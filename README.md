# Learning-Golang-Network-Programming
I have recently started to learn Golang, and am very curious in how to program web apps with the language. In finding help in this area, I have struggled to find clear and easy-to-follow resources for learning this part of Golang.

Due to this, I thought it would be a good idea to share what I learn as I go, and maybe help other people who are a bit stuck like me.

As I am very new to all of this, I may get some things wrong out of confusion in certain areas, if you look through this repo and see anything that is not quite correct, please do say and I will make any necessary changes. I am using this repo to mostly learn about an area which is very new to me.
