Handler Func Interface:

A 'handler func' function consists of two required parameters

Your handlerfunc function is used to determine what you will do with the request, and what will need to be displayed.

Required Layout of the handlerfunc function:
handlerfunc(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)

w is a type http.ResponseWriter, the w value will be our response to the client. Basically we will write to it and this will be what is used to display to the web page.
w has a write function, e.g w.Write([]byte("Hello World")) which is just appending an array of bytes to the web page to be displayed.
Or you have w.Write([]byte("<h1>Hello World</h1>")) which will be read as HTML that can be displayed on the web page.
You need to convert any parameter into an array of bytes as that is the expected agruement for the .Write function.


The r value is a type http.Request, it is sent as a pointer (*) which means it acts as a reference to a http.Request. 
r will contain information about the request sent from the client(user).

Your handlerfunc will be passed as a parameter to HandleFunc.

HandleFunc designates which function will be used to respond to the client's HTTP request.

HandleFunc("/", handlerfunc)

The "/" as the first arguement means that handlerfunc is used for all web addresses without additional routes to the web address.
If for example, another HandleFunc was provided such as HandleFunc("/hello",helloHandlerFunc) then the helloHandlerFunc would be used whenever "/hello" is a route in the web address.
