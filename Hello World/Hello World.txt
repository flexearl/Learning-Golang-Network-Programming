Handler Func Interface:

A 'handler func' function consists of two required parameters

handlerfunc(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)

w is a type http.ResponseWriter, the w value will be our response to the client. Basically we will write to it and this will be what is used to display to the web page.
w has a write function, e.g w.Write([]byte("Hello World")) which is just appending an array of bytes to the web page to be displayed.
Or you have w.Write([]byte("<h1>Hello World</h1>")) which will be read as HTML that can be displayed on the web page.
You need to convert any parameter into an array of bytes as that is the expected agruement for the .Write function.


The r value is a type http.Request, it is sent as a pointer (*) which means it acts as a reference to a http.Request. 
r will contain information about the request sent from the client(user).
